Turtles
=======

Turtles is an Emacs elisp package that helps write ERT-based tests
that check how Emacs renders buffers and windows. The ERT tests can be
run interactively or in batch mode. You'll find the source code of
this package on https://github.com/szermatt/turtles

Go to :ref:`tut` to get started.

Turtles is especially suited to test:

- the effect of display, before-string, after-string text properties

- the effect of overlays

- text visibility

- mode lines

- complex minibuffer interactions
