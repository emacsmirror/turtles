@subsection Code contributions


To contribute code to the project, open a Pull Request@footnote{https://github.com/szermatt/turtles/pulls}.

Before you do that, please make sure the any new features is covered
by tests and that the tests pass.

To run the tests, install and setup eldev@footnote{https://github.com/emacs-eldev/eldev}, then run @code{eldev
test}.

Tests can also be run from inside of Emacs, using @cite{M-x ert-run-tests-interactively} but when you do so, be aware that there
might be unexpected interaction with your Emacs configurations. The
tests passing reliably when run using @code{eldev test} is what
matters.

Please also make sure your commit message follows Conventional Commits 1.0.0@footnote{https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/}.

@subsection Documentation contributions


You don’t need to be a developer to contribute! Contribution to the
documentation or code comments are very welcome. Please open a Pull Request@footnote{https://github.com/szermatt/turtles/pulls} with your proposed modifications.

The documentation is written in reStructuredText. You’ll need to
install Sphinx@footnote{https://www.sphinx-doc.org} to build it:

@example
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate # or activate.fish on fish
pip3 install -r docs/requirements.txt
@end example

Then run @code{eldev html} to build the documentation.
